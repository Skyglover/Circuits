# Circuits
This repository contains the schematics and simulation of some useful circuits.

## Battery Backup Circuit
This circuit provides a battery backup when the main power is out.
In addition, it includes a voltage comparator that determines if the battery backup is being used.
This voltage comparator could be sent to a GPIO on a microcontroller.
